The file tracklist.txt contains a tab delimited list of tracks and their associated reference segmentations.

The reference segmentations are in WaveSurfer .lab format: each line contains
start-time end-time segment-type
(the times are in seconds from the beginning of the track).

Segmentations 1-16 were made by Mark Levy.
Segmentations 17-30 were made for the MPEG-7 committee by Geoffroy Peeters (see separate Peeters_README.txt).
Segmentations 31-60 were made by Katy Noland and Mark Levy following Allan Pollack's `Notes On...' analyses and based on timings provided by Chris Harte.
